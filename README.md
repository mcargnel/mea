## Project Overview

Traditional panel data analysis in economics relies heavily on classical econometric models, such as linear fixed and random effects. While powerful for causal inference and controlling unobserved heterogeneity, these approaches require strong assumptions about functional form and variable relationships, which may not hold in complex or nonlinear data environments.

This thesis explores the integration of machine learning—specifically, Random Forests—into panel data analysis. Random Forests and other tree-based ensemble methods offer a flexible, data-driven alternative that can capture intricate patterns without rigid model specifications. Recent advances in interpretability have also made these "black box" models more accessible and informative for applied researchers.

**Objective:**  
To provide a comprehensive theoretical and practical framework for applying Random Forests to economic panel data, empowering economists with robust, complementary tools alongside conventional econometric techniques.
