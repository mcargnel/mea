# Master's Thesis: Double Machine Learning for Difference in Differences: Fundamentals and applications

Welcome to the repository for my Master's thesis in Applied Economics at the Universidad de Buenos Aires (UBA). Here you'll find all the code, data, and documentation supporting my work. **Please note:** This is a work in progress and subject to ongoing updates.

## Accessing the Thesis

Compiled documents are available in the `_book/` directory:

- **PDF version:** `_book/Double-Machine-Learning-for-Difference-in-Difference--Fundamentals-and-Application.pdf`
- **HTML version:** `book/index.html`

## To do - by section
- [ ] Maintain the same nomenclature across sections...
- [ ] Improve plots and table captions and titles

### 1_intro.qmd
- [X] Proofread 
- [X] probably divide it with related work

### 3_did.qmd
- [X] Add covariates section
- [X] expand parallel lines assumption explanation, include plot
- [ ] Explain parallel lines assumption for staggered

### 4_dml.qmd
- [ ] complete explanation for DML for DID
- [ ] complete explanation for DML for staggered DID
- [ ] proofread

### 5_application.qmd
- [X] Finish first approach
