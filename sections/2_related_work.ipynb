    "The analysis of panel data has been a widely used in empirical economics research. Classical approaches, as documented by [@Cameron_Trivedi_2005] and [@Wooldridge_2010], have primarily relied on linear fixed and random effects models. These methods have proven valuable for controlling unobserved heterogeneity and conducting causal inference. However, as noted by Hsiao (2014), these traditional approaches often struggle with complex, non-linear relationships and high-dimensional interactions."

[@athey_2015] provide a comprehensive framework for using machine learning in causal inference, while [@mullainathan_2017] discuss the practical applications of machine learning in econometrics. [@varian_2014] highlights how big data and machine learning techniques can complement traditional econometric methods."

[@wager_2017] developed methods for estimating heterogeneous treatment effects using Random Forests, while [@athey_2018] introduced Generalized Random Forests for causal inference. [@chernozhukov_2024] proposed Double/Debiased Machine Learning approaches that combine traditional econometric methods with machine learning techniques."
