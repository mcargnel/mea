    "The analysis of panel data has been a widely used in empirical economics research and there are many papers and textbooks documenting the methodology. Classical approaches, as documented by [@Cameron_Trivedi_2005] and [@Wooldridge_2010], have primarily relied on linear fixed and random effects models. These methods have proven valuable for controlling unobserved heterogeneity and conducting causal inference. However, these traditional approaches often struggle with complex, non-linear relationships and high-dimensional interactions."

    "Comprehensive overviews of classic machine learning algorithms—including regularization techniques, tree-based ensembles, and neural networks—are provided in [@ESL], while [@ISLP] offers a more introductory perspective. The foundational details of Classification and Regression Trees (CART) are discussed in [@CART], and the Random Forest algorithm was specifically introduced by [@breiman2001a].\n",

    "In recent years, [@mullainathan_2017] have explored the practical applications of machine learning in econometrics, particularly emphasizing prediction and cautioning against drawing causal conclusions about the effects of independent variables without careful consideration. [@varian_2014] highlights how big data and machine learning techniques, especially tree-based models, can complement traditional econometric methods, excelling in settings with non-linearities and complex interactions.\n",

    "The integration of machine learning methods into economics has accelerated, with increasing attention on adapting these tools for econometric analysis. For example, [@athey_2015] provide a framework for using machine learning algorithms in causal inference; [@wager_2017] develop methods for estimating heterogeneous treatment effects using Random Forests; [@Grimmer_Messing_Westwood_2017] extend these approaches to ensemble methods; and [@athey_2018] introduce Generalized Random Forests for causal inference."
