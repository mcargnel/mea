Machine Learning (ML) models have traditionally been associated with prediction tasks due to their flexibility, while social scientists have typically relied on simpler, often linear, regressions for assessing causality. However, a novel framework named Double Machine Learning (DML) has emerged, providing a way to leverage the predictive performance of these complex methods for robust causal estimation. This thesis examines the fundamentals and applications of double machine learning for two distinct popular Difference-in-Differences (DiD) settings.
